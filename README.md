## üìù About Project  
In our project, we are designing a **low-power, area-efficient 6T SRAM bitcell** optimized for the **GF180MCU-D  standard cell**.  
The goal is to develop a memory cell with enhanced **read stability, write margin, and leakage performance** for integration into open-source SoCs, supporting standard open-source tool flows.

We aim to make this a reusable, reliable memory building block for future **GF180MCU** projects by the community.

## üéØ Objectives
1. Perform **schematic design** of the SRAM bitcell using Xschem with GF180MCU devices.
2. Run **read/write simulations** across PVT corners to optimize SNM and margins.
3. Develop **DRC/LVS-clean layout** using Magic with optimized area footprint.
4. Validate the layout through **netgen LVS** against schematic.
5. Perform **PEX extraction and SPICE simulations** for accurate behavior.
6. Create standard cell views for integration: **GDS, Verilog, Liberty, LEF**.
